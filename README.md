Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Petr PivoÅˆka and I do stuff under the alias BigBang1112 and/or Realnest.

My development journey started when I was 9 years old with web development, and accelerated with [thenewboston C# YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_9lfHjYtVg&list=PL0EE421AE8BCEBA4A). I enjoyed attending programming competitions in ÄŒeskÃ© BudÄ›jovice until the end of high school (my best being 3rd in CZ) and somehow went nuts in Trackmania coding projects, earlier with ManiaScript (ingame scripting language), but now with C#.

I have 4 years of active C# experience (10 years since I first started using the language), but I still don't know how to properly write my own Stream implementations. Oops

I'm also interested in Lua and I'm actively learning Rust.

I'm an "occasional" videomaker with [over 300 videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BigBang1112tm) and I also produce Drum & Bass music [under the Realnest moniker](https://www.youtube.com/@RealnestMusic) with 50+ finished (200+ unfinished) musical projects.
