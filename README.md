Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Petr PivoÅˆka and I do stuff under the alias BigBang1112.

I touched my first coding book (website development respectively) when I was 9 years old, and got introduced to C# when I was 12 thanks to the amazing [thenewboston YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_9lfHjYtVg&list=PL0EE421AE8BCEBA4A) (because I wanted to make a Windows app). This is where I found my developer-self and it changed everything in my life.

I'm currently studying Business Informatics at University of South Bohemia in ÄŒeskÃ© BudÄ›jovice.

- 3 years of active C#/.NET experience (11 years of total experience)
- Basics: SQL, Python, Lua, PHP
- 3rd in national programming competition (2021)
- Good knowledge of ManiaScript
- Produced over [300 videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BigBang1112tm)
- 50+ finished (200+ unfinished) musical projects

My personal and more technical projects are usually related to the game Trackmania for its endless exploration capabilities.

Some of my currently active projects:

- GBX.NET
- Gbx Web Tools
- Randomizer TMF
- ManiaAPI.NET
- TmEssentials
- [ManiaScript Reference](https://github.com/BigBang1112/maniascript-reference)
- .. a couple more I work on in secret!
