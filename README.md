Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Petr PivoÅˆka and my alias is BigBang1112. I'm a 21 years old student of Business Informatics at University of South Bohemia in ÄŒeskÃ© BudÄ›jovice. I'm majorly focused around C#/.NET tool/web development, but I also know basics of SQL, Python, Lua, PHP, and Trackmania's scripting language ManiaScript. I also want to start learning F#.

I'm passionate about coding from the age of 9 and my passion hasn't got any lower since then. I also participated in several programming competitions.

My projects are usually surrounded around the game Trackmania for its endless exploration capabilities. I like opening things up, but I also respect the security.
